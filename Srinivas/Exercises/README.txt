  1. These are the exercise problems from the book "Learning Perl.pdf" 
  2. The pdf is present in the "Learning Material" folder
  3. There is a minor issue in the numbering of the problems
      a. They are basically numbered one chapter up
      b. Meaning 2.1 is actually first problem in 'Third' chapter (Not second)
